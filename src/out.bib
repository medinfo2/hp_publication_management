We propose an experiment in which the game design is analyzed with respect to how social interaction affects player's daily activity levels. In order to allow comparison between test and control groups, different variations of the game were designed, including one with no social interaction and two others including presential and remote social interaction.},

We describe a pervasive game developed to test how design elements can affect older adults' levels of physical activity, using social interaction as case study. Two variations of the game were developed – including or not social interaction – and a feasibility study was performed to evaluate the proposed design and its potential to affect the levels of physical activity of players.},

 abstract = {Background: The novel genre of pervasive games, which aim to create more fun and engaging experiences by promoting deeper immersion, could be a powerful strategy to stimulate physical activity among older adults. To use these games more effectively, it is necessary to understand how different design elements affect player behavior. Objective: The aim was to vary a specific design element of pervasive games for older adults, namely social interaction, to test the effect on levels of physical activity. Methods: Over 4 weeks, two variations of the same pervasive game were compared: social interaction for the test group and no social interaction for the control group. In both versions, players had to walk to physical locations and collect virtual cards, but the social interaction version allowed people to collaborate to obtain more cards. Weekly step counts were used to evaluate the effect on each group, and the number of places visited was used as an indicator of play activity. Results: A total of 32 participants were recruited (no social interaction=15, social interaction=17); 18 remained until the end of the study (no social interaction=7, social interaction=11). Step counts during the first week were used as the baseline (no social interaction: mean 17,099.4, SE 3906.5; social interaction: mean 17,981.9, SE 2171.1). For the following weeks, changes to individual baseline were as follows for no social interaction (absolute/proportional): 383.8 (SE 563.8)/1.1% (SE 4.3%), 435.9 (SE 574.5)/2.2% (SE 4.6%), and −106.1 (SE 979.9)/−2.6% (SE 8.1%) for weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For social interaction they were 3841.9 (SE 1425.4)/21.7% (SE 5.1%), 2270.6 (SE 947.1)/16.5% (SE 4.4%), and 2443.4 (SE 982.6)/17.9% (SE 4.7%) for weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Analysis of group effect was significant (absolute change: $η$2=.19, P=.01; proportional change: $η$2=.27, P=.009). Correlation between the proportional change and the play activity was significant (r=.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56), whereas for absolute change it was not. Conclusions: Social interaction design elements of the pervasive game may have some positive effects on the promotion of physical activity, although other factors might also have influenced this effect. http://games.jmir.org/2019/3/e13962/},

Results showed that the choice of theme and overall design of game was adequate, and that elderly people could understand the game rules and their goals while playing. Points of improvement included reducing the complexity of game controls and changing social interaction mechanics to account for situations when there are only a few players active or players are too far apart.},

 abstract = {Background: To parse free text medical notes into structured data such as disease names, drugs, procedures, and other important medical information first, it is necessary to detect medical entities. It is important for an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to have structured data with semantic interoperability to serve as a seamless communication platform whenever a patient migrates from one physician to another. However, in free text notes, medical entities are often expressed using informal abbreviations. An informal abbreviation is a non-standard or undetermined abbreviation, made in diverse writing styles, which may burden the semantic interoperability between EMR systems. Therefore, a detection of informal abbreviations is required to tackle this issue. Objectives: We attempt to achieve highly reliable detection of informal abbreviations made in diverse writing styles. Methods: In this study, we apply the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect informal abbreviations in free text medical notes. Additionally, we use sliding windows to tackle the limited data issue and sample generator for the imbalance class issue, while introducing additional pre-trained features (bag of words and word2vec vectors) to the model. Results: The LSTM model was able to detect informal abbreviations with precision of 93.6%, recall of 57.6%, and F1-score of 68.9%. Conclusion: Our method was able to recognize informal abbreviations using small data set with high precision. The detection can be used to recognize informal abbreviations in real-time while the physician is typing it and raise appropriate indicators for the informal abbreviation meaning confirmation, thus increase the semantic interoperability.},

 abstract = {Subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) notes are widely used by physicians to docu-ment clinical reasoning in assessing, diagnosing, and treating patients. SOAP notes are also used in medical coding tasks for reimbursement of insurance claims. In Indonesia, medical coders who are independent from physicians assess SOAP notes to assign diagnostic codes and medical procedure codes based on the corre-sponding International Classification of Diseases standards. Discrepancies between physicians who write the SOAP notes and coders who assign diagnoses and treatments, may occur. These discrepancies were assessed by performing a video-based survey to understand the coder's perspective, allowing the development of a writing support system to achieve unproblematic SOAP notes. This survey found that problematic SOAP notes were not caused by a single problem but by multiple problems. Abbreviations used by physicians are the major problem in assigning diagnostic codes, whereas incomplete data are the major problem in determining plan-ning. This survey also showed that problematic SOAP notes may contain helpful keywords for coders that can help in determining diagnosis and treatment. The findings show that the system should be able to recognize sep-arate sections of the SOAP note to provide writing support features and identify helpful keywords to encourage physicians to write unproblematic SOAP notes.},

 abstract = {Objectives: Emergency Physicians utilize multiple patient information (PI) sources within Emergency Departments. Access to a centralized health record system is ideal but not always available to physicians. A technological gap exists in the context of PI sharing regarding patients' representative and their in-situ involvement as an alternative PI source. The purpose of this study is to understand emergency physicians' perceptions about patients' representative and our design concept for improvement of PI sharing to physicians. Methods: Observations focused on physician's interaction with representatives were used to understand the emergency setting which led to a mobile PI sharing application design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three experienced physicians to obtain their perceptions about the usefulness of our proposed design. Results: Physicians shared their experiences about interactions with patient representatives and perceptions about potential use our proposed design concept. Physicians' main problems during interaction with representatives were insufficient PI and occasional unfavorable attitudes. Regarding our design concept, physicians' perceived benefits were reduced information-seeking time, reduced PI search actions, and reduced stress. Physicians' perceived shortcomings were related inter-department PI sharing features and insufficient PI relating patients' daily activities prior to admission and a do not resuscitate policy. Conclusion: Physicians are willing to use our design concept in the future if concerns about security, upto- date PI and PI reliability are addressed. Although our current design concept focuses on the point of interaction between physicians and representatives, our scope will be widened to consider inter-ED PI sharing features and event-based PI.},
