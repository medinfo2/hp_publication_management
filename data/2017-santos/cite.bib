 abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design of a pervasive game that uses social interaction to increase daily activity among elderly people. We propose an experiment in which the game design is analyzed with respect to how social interaction affects player's daily activity levels. In order to allow comparison between test and control groups, different variations of the game were designed, including one with no social interaction and two others including presential and remote social interaction.},
