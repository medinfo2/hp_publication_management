 abstract = {The goal of this research was to design a solution to detect non-reported incidents, especially severe incidents. To achieve this goal, we proposed a method to process electronic medical records and automatically extract clinical notes describing severe incidents. To evaluate the proposed method, we implemented a system and used the system. The system successfully detected a non-reported incident to the safety management department.},
